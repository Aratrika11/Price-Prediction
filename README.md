# HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION IN WEST BENGAL

# **Introduction:**
This project aims to predict house prices in West Bengal using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on historical real estate data and uses various Python libraries (such as numpy,pandas,matplotlib,Scikit-learn) for data preprocessing, visualization, and model building. 
Additionally, a simple UI application is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with the prediction model.

The model is trained on historical real estate data of WestBengal to predict the future prices of houses,flats,apartments in West Bengal in future.
The primary purpose of the project is to find a well suited housing as per user requirements in various regions in West Bengal and provide with the best housing deal to the user .
